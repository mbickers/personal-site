*Naive Set Theory* is a short introduction to set theory, starting with the basic definition of a set and building up to the set theoretic foundation of arithmetic, important theories and cardinal numbers.
The content of the book was almost all new for me, so I can't compare it to other sources or say if it misses anything important.
But I can say it is well written---I came away from each chapter feeling like I understood what was going on.

A [different review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/na-ve-set-theory), presumably from someone who actually knows what he is talking about, explains that the *Naive* in the title means the book is meant to build intuition rather than be a strict development of theory.
That was definitely my experience with the book, and aligned with my purpose for reading it.
In line with the lighter overall treatment of set theory, the book is occasionally funny, with Halmos needling notation and vocabulary he doesn't like.
He also frequently gives summaries of new material with more intuitive language, which I found super helpful.
Overall, the humor, summaries and pace do a great job making the book readable and memorable.
For me, it was a fantastic first look at set theory.
