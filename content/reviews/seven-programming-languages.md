*Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks* is a really cool book.
The purpose of the book isn't just to expand the reader's toolbox of languages.
Instead, the premise of the book is that the ideas and techniques in one language expand one's mind and are often applicable beyond the scope of that particular language.
As such, the book isn't a practical guide to programming in a given language.
Tate might show a "Hello, World" program, but then talk about the history and influences of a language and then give a longer code sample that shows off the languages strengths.
The examples are often short, seemingly simple programs in the given language that demonstrate an approach that might be painful or impossible in many other languages.

The languages explored in the book are Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell.
I particularly liked learning about Io.
Being inspired by Smalltalk, it made me recognize inherited Smalltalk elements of the language shared with Objective-C, a language I was already pretty familiar with.
For example, it helped me understand square bracket syntax for invoking methods in Objective-C isn't just a wacky syntax choice, instead, it reflects the idea of sending a message to an object as one can do in Smalltalk or Io.

While a feature or premise in one language may not have an analogue in another, many of the concepts covered in the book have already found applicability for me.
This book is definitely worth a read if you don't have experience with other programming paradigms or a diverse set of languages and want to expand your horizons.
