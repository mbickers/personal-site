In *Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment* (referred to as APUE in the text), authors Stevens and Rago explore different aspects of the Unix standard.
I enjoyed this classic because it struck a balance between programming reference and exposition/explanation.
I read APUE because I wanted to build a foundational understanding of the concepts I needed to know for operating system programming, and the book was a huge success from that perspective.
APUE did a great job of introducing and discussing the vast set of resources defined in the Unix standard, and I feel like it gave me a great starting point for more learning-for future projects, I'd have a basic understanding of what's going on, and I'd know what to google when things aren't going right.
At the same time, though, I'd want to use APUE as a reference book, because of its precise definitions and great examples.
APUE does a fantastic balancing act that means there's something in it for everybody.

After two Unix overview chapters, APUE is divided into chapters based on concepts, like File I/O, Signals and Process Control.
At the end, there are two chapters dedicated to larger exercises: building a database library and communicating with a network printer.

The first two chapters outline the book as a whole and talk about this history of Unix, including its history and considerations when developing for different implementations of the standard.

The concept oriented chapters all provide an introduction, and often build up to more advanced ideas or are structured corresponding to how things are typically used within a program.
Some chapters, like those on Daemons and Threading, described concepts developers often run in to and need to understand.
Others, like those on System Data Files and Pseudo Terminals, were less immediatly relevant to me, but still interesting.
I got the most out of the File I/O chapter because it was directly applicable to work I was doing, and it was super cool to come back to work after reading those chapters and a have a substantially better understanding of the code I was working with.

I only skimmed the larger implementation chapters, because my intention was to use APUE as an introduction to core Unix concepts.
Likewise, although I read through most of the exercises and their solutions to check my understanding, I didn't actually go through and try to write them on my own.
That was fine for my introductory usage of the book, but obviously, you get what you put into it, and I would've come away with a deeper understanding if I had put more time into it.
From just skimming the exercises, however, I can tell that they've been meticously put together and tested.
They also touch on programs and concepts that could be directly relevant to modern projects, even though some were written almost 30 years ago-the deep dive database implementation project especially stand out in that regard.
I fully intend to go back and try some of the exercises seriously in the future.

APUE was a great book that I know I will reference and reread in the future.
I came at this book with some programming experience and macOS command line familarity, but this book would also be valuable for people with far more programming experience that want to deepend their understanding of parts of Unix they may not have worked with before.
It's an informative read that's got something in it for everyone.
