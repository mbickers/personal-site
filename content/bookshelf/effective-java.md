My last experience with Java was AP Computer Science a few years ago, and with a new, Java-focused job starting soon, I decided I should do a little review.

*Effective Java* is organized into 90 rules that each discuss how to deal with a part of the language or solve a common problem.
The rules are organized into different chapters with common themes, like generics, enums, or exceptions.
The rules are all extremely clear, and there is always discussion about problems with other approaches, as well as tradeoffs that have to be considered, particularly with respect to performance and long term maintainabiliy.

I'd recommend going in with some understanding of design patterns in software engineering as well as experience with an Object-oriented language (not necessarily Java).
The rules are all Java specific, but often reference common problems and implementation choices.
Knowledge of Object-oriented programming and related design patterns is essential for understanding where and why the rules Bloch discusses are relevant.

One of the recurring themes in the text is that Java is imperfect, and often the Java API doesn't follow the best practices enumerated in the book, usually because the API is designed to maintain backwards compatability.
The book also explains that many aspects of the Java language itself are imperfect, and with hindsight, should've been implemented differently--again, the need for backwards compatability trumps perfection.
Getting a glimpse at this underlying language philosophy was extremely interesting for me, especially because other languages I know well have deeply different philosophies.

Although the book isn't designed to teach Java, and in the introduction, Bloch explicitly states the book isn't meant to be read cover to cover, as I did, I think I came away with a greatly improved understanding of what to be aware of to write maintainable Java code, and the book's ninety rules addressed many pitfalls I definitely would've run into.
I'm excited to start using Java soon, and I'm sure what I've learned in *Efffective Java* will come in handy.
