This little (207 page) book is a wonderful "second look" at linear algebra, great for building a deep intuition for some of the most important concepts and results in the field.
I say "second look" because prior exposure and intuition around linear algebra is required, but for readers with that experience, and who are willing to invest their time into a deep read of this book, the payoff is incredbible.

There are two reasons this book is so great.
First, the exposition is beautiful.
On the broader scale, the division into chapters and short (~1-5 page) sections make for bite sized reads, and an easy way to flip back and reference earlier concepts.
Within sections, the definitions, proofs and intuitive explanations flow together perfectly.
So many times while reading, a question or idea I had would be discussed in the next paragraph, and the way Halmos explained things resonated with me much more than other texts have.

Secondly, the exercises are perfect.
There are problem sets every couple chapters, and the exercises were all carefully chosen to hint at (or prime the reader for, per se) upcoming sections or connect to other branches of mathematics.
I made a point to look at all the exercises, and the ones I could do were all incredibly rewarding.

Within the book, I particularly loved the lead-up and proof of Jordan form, the introduction to tensors and the tensor product, and the intuition around normal matrices, but I plan to reread in the future and see what more I can glean from the other sections.

This book doesn't have many flaws, although sometimes the language is a little dated, and frankly, I can't imagine reading this 50 years ago without the ability to look things up or find alternate proofs.

But all in all, this was the most rewarding math book I've read yet.
Without a doubt, *Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces* is a masterpiece.
