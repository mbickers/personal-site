Title = "The Go Programming Language"

+++

*The Go Programming Language* is a good first introduction to Go.
The book does a fine job of going over the essentials of the language, but its biggest strength is that it does a good job of capturing the ethos and motivation behind Go.
The features and aspects of Go are not just presented as a "how-to", but there are explanations of *why*, and comparisons with the languages that inspired and spurred the language's creation.

The section on multithreading in Go is particularly robust, with good explanations of both the unique Go approach and multithreading paradigms and common problems in general.

Avoid the ebook versions if possible.
I initially tried using the O'Reilly online version but there were lots of formatting issues.
Amazon reviewers also had problems with the Kindle version.

The book is substantially out of date in some areas. For example, there is no mention of how Go modules currently work.
However, the book is still a good way to get started with the Go language.
