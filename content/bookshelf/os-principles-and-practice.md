*Operating Systems: Principles and Practice* covers the material one would expect to learn in a first course on operating systems.
Most sections of the book start with discussion on the interface that operating systems provide to programs, (e.g. concurrency primitives or virtual memory), and then delve into a basic implementation, followed by case studies and where relevant research is heading now.
The book also includes many asides, which discuss the history of an aspect of operating systems or alternative approaches.

Most of the content of the book is pretty digestible, and the case studies are all interesting and relevant.
Chapter 9, on caching and virtual memory, was particularly well written.
I really liked the discussion on when caches work well and when they reach limitations or pathological cases, 

Perhaps it is difficult to write a beautiful operating systems book (particularly one for undergrads), given that a general textbook has to cover so much and that the field is still evolving.
However, there were a few flaws that make the book tough to recommend:
- Beyond brief mentions, there is no discussion of network programming, not even the basic abstractions operating systems provide (although that is a topic that could can span many books on its own).
- Sometimes the book gets a little mathy, such as offering a proof for why a particular algorithm is optimal or relating parameters and performance with equations.  Normally I'd love this sort of thing, but the poor mathematical typesetting and lack of integration with surrounding material both take away from these parts of the book.
- The ebook edition was split into 4 volumes, neither of which was particularly long, making for needlessly difficult for navigation.
