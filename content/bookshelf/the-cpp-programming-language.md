Title = "The C++ Programming Language"

+++

Written by the creator of C++, this book was widely recommended online as a must-read for people who want to move beyond the basics of C++.
Before reading, I fell squarely into that category.
I had taken courses that covered iterators and standard library containers, but not much more than that.
This book helped me build a deeper understanding of C++ and the many language features that are available to programmers.

Bjarne's subtle sense of humor helps keep the text from becoming monotonous.
The examples are often chosen to elicit a laugh, and there are quotes at the beginning of each chapter that relate to content in a humorous way. 
I won't lie---in some chapters, I started skimming, just reading the examples and particularly interesting bits.
With a book like this one, I think that's ok.
I came away with a better understanding of what features are available in C++, enough to know what might be applicable in a given problem.

In the introduction, Stroustrup emphasizes that the book isn't a reference book.
It systematically goes over different aspects of C++, but the chapters are more like tutorials than technical specifications.
The book can be read cover to cover, like I read it, or in a more random access sort of way, flipping to a chapter to quickly build an understanding of one specific part of the language.

One thing I didn't like was the online typesetting.
I read the book through O'Reilly Safari Books Online, which was nice because it was free through school, but not nice because there were frequent typos and distracting formatting issues in the code.
