*Understanding Analysis* is an introduction to real analysis, building up from important properties of the real numbers to a rigourous definition of differentiation, uniform convergence and its properties, and the Riemann integral.
The book also introduces some more advanced topics, including a rigourous construction of the reals from the rationals and (a version of) Baire's category theorem.

The book is divided into eight chapters, most of which begin with a 'discussion' section.
These discussion sections are fantastic.
They usually present a motivating example for the upcoming chapter, demonstrating where naive intuition may fail and illustrating the history of what the reader is about to learn.
The discussion sections prevent *Understanding Analysis* from becoming a monotonous progression of proofs, and the discussion of history is interesting and ties together different chapters.

Each chapter also has an epilogue, discussing both modern applications and the limitations of the chapter's techniques.
For example, the epilogue of Chapter 7 (Riemann Integration) introduces the Lebesgue integral, and discusses its power and drawbacks.
The discussion and epilogue sections, although not strictly necessary, were fantastic additions, and I wish more books had similar approaches.

Sandwiched between the discussions and epilogue of each chapter is the meat of the text, divided into 5-10 page sections that build up to specfic theorems and definitions.
The exposition is dense but understandable, and there are many inline, guided exercises that discuss or rebut what the reader may be thinking as they finish a proof.
The sections are well organized, making it easy to find a specific definition within the book, and flow coherently from one to the next.

The discussion of the connection between the Axiom of Completeness, Monotone Convergence Theorem and the Archimedean Property was my favorite part of the book, which occurs mostly in section 2.6 but is a continuing thread throughout the text.

*Understanding Analysis* is well typeset (I read the pdf version from SpringerLink), and made use of document navigation and internal hyperlinks.

I read *Understanding Analysis* to supplement my analysis class, and it was great in that role.
However, I was pretty initimidated when I first opened the book to try and self study before the class started--so I don't know if I'd recommend it for that purpose.
