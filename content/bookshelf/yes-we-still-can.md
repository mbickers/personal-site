Pfeiffer is one of the hosts of Pod Save America, a political podcast hosted by several Obama administration officials.
As a Pod Save America listener whose favorite parts of the Pod are anecdotes from the Obama White House, there wasn't really any chance that I would dislike reading *Yes We (Still) Can*.

Beyond readers who already know him from his podcast, the book may still be a good read because of his humorous retelling of his personal journey, insight into what the White House is actually like, or as a reminder of what the world was like when there was a more decent and comptetent president in command.

Pfeiffer's own journey to the White House was unique and inspirational, and the president he served under had a campaign and presidency defined by hope.
In a message perfectly captured by the title, *Yes We (Still) Can* shows that there might be a way out of the current political mess, but only if everyone believes they can gets involved and make a difference.

This book was a little dated when I read it, as it was published in 2018.
I'm looking forwards to reading his most recent book "Un-Trumping America," although it may take on a different meaning depending on what happens a week from now, after the 2020 election.
