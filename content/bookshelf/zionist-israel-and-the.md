This book explores the history of Israel and Zionism through primary sources, focusing on ideological contradictions.
Unlike some books on Israel and Palestine, the text is not built around historical 'gotchas' trying to demonize the other side---nor is there is an overarching 'pro-' or 'anti-' argument.
Amar-Dahl takes an academic approach with frequent footnotes, numbers and quotes from Israeli leaders, to discuss the contradictions that arise under critical inspection.

Although information-dense, the book wasn't a difficult read.
I came in with no knowledge beyond the basic history of modern Israel, and I learned a lot from reading it.
A lot of the text is pure quote contextualization and first-level analysis, which helped fill in the gaps of my history knowledge.

There were a few places where the wording felt biased.
For example, the book refered to some conflicts in Israel's history as "wars of conquest," when a quick Google search showed that there wasn't a consensus that "wars of conquest" would be a justified term.
Even the title, "Zionist Israel...," feels reactionary for an academic work, although that could be an artifact of translation from German.
These wording choices were never central to the arguments Amar-Dahl was making, so they are more distracting than anything else.
Nevertheless, they seem like odd choices in a work where that sort of historical controversy is otherwise avoided because evidence comes directly from primary sources.

The most memorable part of the book was the chapter analyzing Israel's dual identity as a Jewish state and a democracy, which usually implies a secular government.
Amar-Dahl explored both philosophical implications discussed in primary sources by Zionist thought leaders, and the practical consequences from throughout Israel's history.

That chapter summed up why I liked reading this book.
It does a good job providing background and introducing meaningful questions, but leaves readers enough space to ponder the bigger implications and come to their own conclusions.
