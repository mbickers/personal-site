In the preface, the author discusses the difference between Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis, and explains that this text is an effort to bridge the gap, straddling both theoretical and applied approaches.

On the theory side, the author made an effort to prove important results, sometimes falling back to slightly weaker statements when it makes proofs simpler and more accessible.
However, the proofs were often convoluted and poorly explained.
In particular, they usually contained oblique references to "Theorem A" or "Chapter 7" that were difficult to follow without rereading the whole chapter and then flipping around the whole book.

Luckily, the applications discussed were interesting and illuminating.
Each chapter included multiple examples, typically applying new techniques to different types of random variables as well as showing how computational approaches might be utilized.
The problems at the end of each chapter built naturally from the examples, and also included proofs of a few interesting corollaries not directly discussed in the text.

The books biggest flaw is that there is no effort to build intuition.
Because of that flaw, and the lack of useful proofs to reference, I wouldn't recommend reading it.
I read *Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis* to supplement my statistics course, but most of the value I got from it was wrangling the example problems to figure out how to apply them to my homework.
